# NOTE: AT THE MOMENT YOU CAN ONLY RUN HARMONYOS NEXT X86 ON QEMU
Requirements:
- a Linux distro (We tested it on Ubuntu 22.04)
- a x86 CPU
- 8GB+ of RAM

As for now, we have a x86 version of HarmonyOS NEXT, here's some specifications:
- There's only the Chinese language
- It can run only on QEMU
- This is the MOBILE version of HarmonyOS, but ported for X86, we will try to get a desktop version soon

# How to test it:

1) Start your Linux Machine
2) Install all the needed packages:
   ```
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
    sudo apt-get install qemu-system
   ```
3) Download the [Emulation package](https://devuploads.com/a26udyse57sh)
4) Unzip the Emulation package
   ```
    unzip system-image-phone-x86-DB1.zip /system-image-phone-x86-DB1
    cd system-image-phone-x86-DB1
   ```
5) Run QEMU
   ```
    qemu-system-x86 -enable-kvm -machine virt -cpu host -display none -serial stdio -kernel Image -append console=ttyAMA0
   ```
   Note:
     - Remove "-enable-kvm" if it gives you an error
     - Remove "-cpu host" if your running this into a VM
     - Remove "-display none" if you want to see a display output
6) Enjoy!
